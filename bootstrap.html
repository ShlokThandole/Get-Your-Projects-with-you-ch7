                            <b class="text-success">Sloths</b> can fall to their death: Some sloths have been known to grab their own arms and fall to their death because they can
                            mistake their arms for tree branches.
                            <b class="text-success">Sloths </b>are great swimmers: Sloths can swim three times faster than they can walk on land, and their preferred swimming
                            style is the backstroke.Sloths have poor eyesight: Sloths are colorblind and can barely see in bright sunlight.
                            <b class="text-success">Sloths</b> have unusual bathroom habits: Sloths only poop once a week, and can lose up to a third of their body weight in
                            one sitting. They dig a hole on the ground after wiggling around the base of a tree.
                            <b class="text-success">Sloths </b>have large, curved claws: Sloths use their large, curved claws to grip the branches and trunks of the trees they
                            live in.
                            <b class="text-success">Sloths</b> don't sleep as much as you might think: Wild sloths only sleep for 8-10 hours a day on average.
                            <b class="text-success">Sloths</b> have predators: Jaguars and eagles are common predators of sloths.

                            <b class="text-success">Sloths</b> are famous for their bizarre bathroom habits. They will only relieve themselves once a week and can lose up to a
                            third of their body weight in one sitting! Furthermore, they will only do it on the ground after wiggling around the
                            base of a tree to dig a little hole.
